# Heldertheking's Media Lab setup

This repo is a representation of the media server setup I have on my personal homelab.

## Services

This implementation makes use of an ***arr** stack in combination with usenet and NZB downloading to make a fully legal and low cost system for personal media consumption

It includes:  
- Radarr
- Sonarr
- Prowlarr
- Bazarr
- SabNZBd
- Jellyfin
- Jellyseerr

This setup allows for simple setup and minimul maintnance on the long run.
